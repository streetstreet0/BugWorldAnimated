This was a project I did during my Masters of Software Development.   
This project is a animated version of a basic simulation of a group of bugs. It also contains a basic guessing game.

### Disclaimer

This project was created early in the degree, and it has not been worked on since.

### Notes

**Note:** you will need to change the path to javafx to get this to work on a different computer.

**Note:** the bugworld is extremely laggy when using images. You can disable images by renaming the images folder. 

**Note:** you will need to increase the ram of the virtual machine with -Xmx4096m in the run configuration program argument
